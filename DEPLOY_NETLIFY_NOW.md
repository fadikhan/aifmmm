# ⚡ DEPLOY TO NETLIFY NOW - FIXED!

## ✅ The Issue is Fixed!

I've updated `netlify.toml` to set the correct base directory.

---

## 🚀 DEPLOY NOW (2 Steps)

### Step 1: Push the Fix
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Netlify base directory"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Wait for Auto-Deploy
- Netlify will automatically detect the push
- Build will start in ~30 seconds
- Wait 3-5 minutes for completion
- Your site will be live!

---

## 🔍 Monitor the Build

1. Go to your Netlify dashboard
2. Click on your site
3. Click **"Deploys"** tab
4. Watch the build progress
5. When it shows **"Published"** → Success! ✅

---

## ⚠️ If Build Still Fails

### Make Sure Environment Variables Are Added

Go to **Site settings** → **Environment variables**

You need ALL 6 variables:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY
SUPABASE_BUCKET_ASSETS
NODE_ENV
```

**Copy values from**: `NETLIFY_ENV_VARIABLES.txt`

After adding variables:
1. Go to **Deploys** tab
2. Click **"Trigger deploy"** → "Clear cache and deploy site"

## 📋 What Was Fixed

### Before (Broken):
```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = ".next"
```
❌ No base directory specified

### After (Fixed):
```toml
[build]
  base = "."
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = ".next"
```
✅ Base directory set to root

---

## ✅ After Successful Deploy

Visit your Netlify URL: `https://your-site.netlify.app`

You should see:
- ✅ AIFS homepage with robot background
- ✅ "Get Started" button works
- ✅ "Sign In" button works
- ✅ No errors in console
