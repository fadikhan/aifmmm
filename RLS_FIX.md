# üîí Fix for RLS Policy Error

## The Problem

You're seeing: `new row violates row-level security policy for table "projects"`

This means Row Level Security is enabled but doesn't allow inserts.

## ‚úÖ Quick Fix (Choose One)

### Option 1: Disable RLS (Easiest for Development)

Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
ALTER TABLE teams DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE projects DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE team_members DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE project_blocks DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE scenes DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE shots DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE tasks DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE assets DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE ai_requests DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE comments DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE revisions DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

**Then try creating a project again - it should work! ‚úÖ**

### Option 2: Allow All Operations (Keep RLS Enabled)

If you want to keep RLS enabled but allow all operations:

```sql
-- Drop existing policies first
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Team members can access projects" ON projects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view teams they belong to" ON teams;

-- Create permissive policies
CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations on projects" ON projects
  FOR ALL
  USING (true)
  WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations on teams" ON teams
  FOR ALL
  USING (true)
  WITH CHECK (true);
```

### Option 3: Use Service Role Key (Bypasses RLS)

Update your `.env.local` to use the service role key temporarily:

```bash
# Change from anon key to service role key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
```

Then update `lib/supabaseClient.ts` to use service role for writes.

## üéØ Recommended: Option 1

For development, **just disable RLS** on all tables. This is the simplest solution.

1. Copy the SQL from `db/migrations/003_disable_rls.sql`
2. Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
3. Click **Run**
4. Try creating a project again

---

## üîç Why This Happened

RLS (Row Level Security) is enabled but there's no policy that allows creating projects. The migration commented out RLS policies, but they might have been enabled from a previous run.

---

## ‚úÖ After the Fix

Create a project - it should work now! üéâ

**Note**: For production, you'll want to set up proper RLS policies with user authentication. But for development, disabling RLS is fine.
