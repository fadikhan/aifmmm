# 🧪 TEST: Generate Scenes Feature

## What Was Fixed

The API was returning a single analysis object, but the code was treating it as an array.

### Before (Broken):
```javascript
const analyses = await response.json()
if (analyses.length > 0) {  // ❌ Treating object as array
  const latestAnalysis = analyses[0]
  const analysisData = latestAnalysis.analysis_data  // ❌ Wrong property
```

### After (Fixed):
```javascript
const analysis = await response.json()
if (analysis && analysis.scenes) {  // ✅ Correct object check
  const analysisScenes = analysis.scenes  // ✅ Direct access
```

## How to Test

### Step 1: Verify Storyboard Analysis Exists

1. Go to **Studio tab** in your project
2. Check if there's a saved analysis
3. If not, upload and analyze a storyboard first

### Step 2: Test Generate Scenes

1. Go back to **main project page**
2. Click **"Generate Scenes"** button
3. Should see: `✅ Generated X scenes from storyboard!`
4. Scenes should appear in the list below

### Step 3: Verify Scene Data

Check that scenes have:
- ✅ Title (from storyboard)
- ✅ Content/Description
- ✅ Proper order

---

## Expected Data Structure

The storyboard analysis should look like:

```json
{
  "id": "...",
  "project_id": "...",
  "filename": "storyboard.jpg",
  "scenes": [
    {
      "title": "Opening Scene",
      "description": "A dark alley at night...",
      "dialogue": "...",
      "action": "..."
    },
    {
      "title": "Scene 2",
      "description": "...",
      ...
    }
  ],
  "overall_description": "...",
  "metadata": {...}
}
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Still Getting "No storyboard analysis found"?

**Check 1: Verify analysis exists in database**
```javascript
// In browser console on Studio page:
fetch('/api/storyboard-analyses?project_id=YOUR_PROJECT_ID')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(console.log)
```

**Check 2: Verify project ID matches**
- Make sure you're in the same project
- Check URL: `/projects/[id]` - the ID should match

**Check 3: Verify scenes array exists**
```javascript
// Should see scenes array in the response
{
  "scenes": [...]  // ✅ This should exist
}
```

### Scenes Generated But Empty?

The code tries multiple properties:
1. `scene.title` or `scene.description` → Title
2. `scene.description` or `scene.dialogue` or `scene.action` or `scene.details` → Content

If all are missing, shows "No description available"

---

## Debug Mode

Add this to see what data is being fetched:

```javascript
// In app/projects/[id]/page.tsx, add after fetch:
console.log('📊 Analysis data:', analysis)
console.log('📊 Scenes:', analysis?.scenes)
```

---

## Success Indicators

✅ Alert shows: "Generated X scenes from storyboard!"
✅ Scenes appear in the list
✅ Each scene has a title and content
✅ Scenes are in correct order
