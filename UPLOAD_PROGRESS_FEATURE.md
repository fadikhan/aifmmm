## Usage Example

```tsx

  projectId={projectId}
  onUploadComplete={(asset) => console.log('Uploaded:', asset)}
  accept="image/*,video/*"
  label="Drop files here"
/>
```

## Technical Details

### Progress Simulation
Since the native `fetch` API doesn't support upload progress tracking, we simulate progress:
- Starts at 0%
- Increments by 10% every 200-300ms
- Stops at 90% until server responds
- Jumps to 100% on completion

### Future Improvements
- [ ] Use XMLHttpRequest for real upload progress
- [ ] Add pause/resume functionality
- [ ] Show upload speed (MB/s)
- [ ] Add file size validation before upload
- [ ] Batch upload queue management
- [ ] Thumbnail preview during upload

## Testing

1. Navigate to any upload area:
   - `/projects/[id]/review` - Video upload
   - `/projects/[id]/studio` - Storyboard upload
   - Any page with AssetUpload component

2. Select a file to upload

3. Observe:
   - Spinning loader appears
   - Progress bar animates from 0% to 100%
   - Success checkmark on completion
   - Progress card auto-dismisses

## Browser Compatibility
- ✅ Chrome/Edge (Chromium)
- ✅ Firefox
- ✅ Safari
- ✅ Mobile browsers
